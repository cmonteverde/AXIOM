# UNDERSTANDING RESEARCH PAPER TYPES
**A Guide to Help You Choose the Right Analysis Module**

## WHY DOES PAPER TYPE MATTER?

Different research types follow different standards. Choosing the right type ensures SAGE gives you:
- ✓ Relevant reporting guidelines (CONSORT, STROBE, COREQ, PRISMA)
- ✓ Field-appropriate language checks
- ✓ Type-specific common errors
- ✓ Accurate feedback

## THE 5 MAIN RESEARCH TYPES

### 1. QUANTITATIVE EXPERIMENTAL 🧪

**What it is**: You actively changed something and measured what happened.

**Key signs**:
- Random assignment to groups
- Control group present
- You manipulated a variable
- Testing cause-and-effect

**Examples**:
- "We randomly assigned 100 patients to receive Drug A or placebo"
- "Participants were randomly divided into treatment and control groups"
- "We conducted a lab experiment manipulating stress levels"

**Choose this if**: You did an experiment, RCT, or clinical trial

**Reporting guideline**: CONSORT 2025

---

### 2. OBSERVATIONAL/CORRELATIONAL 📊

**What it is**: You measured variables without changing anything.

**Key signs**:
- No manipulation
- Measured naturally-occurring behaviors
- Looking at associations/relationships
- Survey, questionnaire, existing data

**Examples**:
- "We surveyed 500 students about social media use and mental health"
- "We followed 1,000 adults for 10 years, tracking diet and heart disease"
- "Medical records were reviewed to examine smoking and cancer rates"

**Choose this if**: Survey research, cohort study, case-control, cross-sectional

**Reporting guideline**: STROBE

---

### 3. QUALITATIVE 💬

**What it is**: You explored experiences, meanings, or contexts through words, not numbers.

**Key signs**:
- Interviews or focus groups
- Themes emerged from data
- NO statistics
- Understanding "how" or "why"
- Lived experiences

**Examples**:
- "We interviewed 18 nurses about their end-of-life care experiences"
- "Through ethnographic observation, we studied workplace culture"
- "Thematic analysis revealed five major themes from participant narratives"

**Choose this if**: Interviews, ethnography, phenomenology, grounded theory

**Reporting guideline**: COREQ

---

### 4. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW 📚

**What it is**: You synthesized existing research studies to answer a question.

**Key signs**:
- You searched databases for studies
- You didn't collect new data
- You analyzed other people's research
- May include meta-analysis (statistical pooling)

**Examples**:
- "We searched PubMed, PsycINFO, and Embase for RCTs comparing..."
- "This meta-analysis pooled data from 23 studies"
- "Systematic review of qualitative studies on patient experience"

**Choose this if**: Literature review, meta-analysis, scoping review

**Reporting guideline**: PRISMA 2020

---

### 5. MIXED METHODS 🔀

**What it is**: You intentionally combined numbers (quantitative) AND words (qualitative) in one study.

**Key signs**:
- Survey + interviews
- RCT + patient experience interviews
- Explicitly states "mixed methods"
- Two phases or components
- **Integration** of both types of data

**Examples**:
- "Phase 1: survey (n=300). Phase 2: interviews (n=20) to explain survey findings"
- "RCT with embedded qualitative interviews to understand participant experiences"
- "Concurrent collection of survey and interview data, merged in analysis"

**⚠️ NOT mixed methods**: Survey + interviews analyzed separately with no connection

**Choose this if**: Deliberately combining quant + qual with integration

**Reporting guideline**: GRAMMS

## DECISION FLOWCHART

```
START: What did you do in your study?

Did you collect NEW data or review EXISTING studies?
├─ NEW data → Continue below
└─ EXISTING studies → Systematic Review (Module 04)

Did you use numbers/statistics OR words/themes?
├─ BOTH (integrated) → Mixed Methods (Module 05)
├─ Numbers/Statistics → Continue below
└─ Words/Themes → Qualitative (Module 03)

Did you manipulate/change anything or just observe?
├─ Manipulated (experiment, RCT) → Quantitative Experimental (Module 01)
└─ Observed (survey, correlation) → Observational (Module 02)
```

## STILL NOT SURE?

### Option 1: "Not Sure - Auto-Detect"

Select this option and SAGE will:
1. Scan your manuscript for keywords
2. Suggest the most likely type
3. Ask you to confirm or correct
4. Load the appropriate analysis

### Option 2: "Generic Review"

Select this for:
- Unusual or complex designs
- You want broad coverage
- You're early in the writing process

**Note**: Generic review is comprehensive but less detailed than type-specific analysis.

---

## COMMON CONFUSIONS

### "I have numbers AND words"

**Question**: Does your study intentionally integrate both to answer the same research question?

**Yes** → Mixed Methods
**No** (just some demographics or quotes as examples) → Choose dominant method

---

### "I interviewed people but counted themes"

**Question**: Did you do statistical tests on theme frequencies?

**Yes** (Chi-square, etc.) → Might be Mixed Methods
**No** (just reporting "5 of 8 participants mentioned...") → Qualitative

---

### "I followed people over time"

**Question**: Did you intervene/manipulate anything?

**Yes** (tested treatment) → Quantitative Experimental (RCT)
**No** (just observed) → Observational (Cohort Study)

---

### "I reviewed literature but didn't do meta-analysis"

Still a **Systematic Review** if you:
- Systematically searched databases
- Used inclusion/exclusion criteria
- Synthesized findings

Just a **narrative/background review** if:
- No systematic search
- Selected articles informally
- Part of introduction (not the study itself)

## EXAMPLES BY FIELD

### Medicine/Clinical
- RCT testing drug → **Quantitative Experimental**
- Chart review of patient outcomes → **Observational**
