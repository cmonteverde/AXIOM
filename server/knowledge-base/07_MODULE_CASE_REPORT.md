# SAGE MODULE: CASE REPORT / CASE SERIES
**Module 07 - Case Reports, Case Series, Clinical Vignettes**
**Version 3.0**
**Last Updated: February 2026**

---

## MODULE SCOPE

This module applies to:
- **Case Reports** — Single patient or case description
- **Case Series** — Multiple related cases (typically 3-10+)
- **Clinical Vignettes** — Brief clinical teaching cases
- **Care Reports** — Detailed clinical care pathway documentation

**Key Characteristic**: Describes the clinical presentation, management, and outcome of one or more specific cases, often highlighting unusual presentations, novel treatments, or educational aspects.

## APPLICABLE REPORTING GUIDELINE: CARE (CAse REport)

**CARE Checklist**: https://www.care-statement.org/checklist

The CARE guideline provides a 13-item checklist for complete and transparent reporting of case reports.

### CARE Checklist Items to Verify:

#### Item 1: Title
```
REQUIRED: "Case report" or "Case series" must appear in the title
Format: "[Condition/Treatment]: A case report" or descriptive equivalent

✓ GOOD: "Successful treatment of refractory migraines with novel CGRP
  antagonist: A case report"
✗ POOR: "An interesting case of migraines" (too vague, missing "case report")
```

#### Item 2: Keywords
```
REQUIRED: Include 2-5 keywords
- Must include the condition/disease
- Must include "case report" or "case series"
- Include treatment if relevant
```

#### Item 3: Abstract
```
REQUIRED structured abstract with:
- Introduction: What is unique about this case? Why is it worth reporting?
- Case Presentation: Chief complaints, diagnoses, interventions, outcomes
- Conclusions: Main takeaway and clinical lesson
```

#### Item 4: Introduction
```
REQUIRED:
- Brief background on the condition
- Rationale for reporting (novelty, rarity, educational value, unexpected outcome)
- Clear statement of what makes this case worth reporting

Common reasons to report a case:
1. Novel or rare disease/presentation
2. Unexpected clinical course
3. Novel therapeutic approach
4. Diagnostic challenge with learning points
5. Previously unreported drug reaction/interaction
6. New disease mechanism illustrated
```

#### Item 5: Patient Information
```
REQUIRED:
- De-identified demographic information
- Chief complaints and symptoms
- Medical history (relevant)
- Family history and psychosocial history (if relevant)
- Genetic information (if relevant)

PRIVACY: All identifying information MUST be removed. If case is identifiable
(rare condition + institution), explicit patient consent for publication required.
```

#### Item 6: Clinical Findings
```
REQUIRED:
- Physical examination findings
- Relevant positive AND negative findings
- Results of diagnostic testing (labs, imaging, pathology)
- Present findings systematically
```

#### Item 7: Timeline
```
REQUIRED: Clear chronological narrative
- Dates of key events (symptom onset, diagnosis, interventions, outcomes)
- CARE recommends a timeline figure/table

Template:
"Day 0: Initial presentation with [symptoms]
 Day 3: Diagnostic workup revealed [findings]
 Day 7: Treatment initiated with [intervention]
 Week 4: Follow-up showed [outcome]"
```

#### Item 8: Diagnostic Assessment
```
REQUIRED:
- Diagnostic methods used
- Diagnostic challenges (if any)
- Diagnostic reasoning process
- Differential diagnosis considered
- Final diagnosis with supporting evidence
```

#### Item 9: Therapeutic Intervention
```
REQUIRED:
- Type(s) of intervention (pharmacologic, surgical, preventive, self-care)
- Administration of intervention (dose, duration, frequency)
- Changes in intervention with rationale

For drug treatments:
- Generic name, dose, route, frequency, duration
- Rationale for selection
- Monitoring parameters
```

#### Item 10: Follow-Up and Outcomes
```
REQUIRED:
- Clinician-assessed outcomes
- Patient-reported outcomes (when available)
- Important follow-up test results
- Intervention adherence and tolerability
- Adverse events (even if none — state explicitly)
```

#### Item 11: Discussion
```
REQUIRED:
- Strengths AND limitations of this case report
- Comparison to relevant medical literature
- Clinical implications and applicability
- Rationale for conclusions
- Main takeaway/lesson for practitioners
```

#### Item 12: Patient Perspective
```
RECOMMENDED (when appropriate):
- Patient's own words about their experience
- Patient's view of treatment
- Impact on quality of life

Note: Not always feasible (deceased patient, loss to follow-up)
```

#### Item 13: Informed Consent
```
REQUIRED:
- Statement that patient (or next of kin) provided consent for publication
- If consent not obtainable, explain why and what de-identification was done

Template:
"Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication
of this case report and any accompanying images."

OR

"The patient is deceased. Consent was obtained from the next of kin."

OR

"Consent could not be obtained. All potentially identifying information
has been removed and the case has been sufficiently anonymized."
```

## STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR CASE SERIES

### When Multiple Cases Reported:

**Descriptive Statistics Only**:
```
Case series should report:
- Frequency counts and percentages
- Means/medians with ranges for continuous variables
- Demographic summary table

DO NOT:
- Perform inferential statistics (no p-values from case series)
- Claim causal relationships
- Generalize to broader populations
```

**Case Series Table Format**:
```
Table 1. Summary of Cases

Case | Age/Sex | Presentation | Treatment | Outcome | Follow-Up
-----|---------|-------------|-----------|---------|----------
1    | 45/F   | [details]   | [details] | [details]| 6 months
2    | 52/M   | [details]   | [details] | [details]| 12 months
3    | 38/F   | [details]   | [details] | [details]| 3 months
```

## CAUSAL LANGUAGE RULES

### Case Reports CANNOT Establish Causation

```
✓ "The patient's symptoms improved following treatment with X"
✓ "Treatment was temporally associated with improvement"
✓ "This case suggests that X may be effective for Y"
✓ "Further investigation is warranted"

✗ "Treatment X cured the condition"
✗ "X caused improvement in symptoms"
✗ "This case proves that X is effective"
✗ "Based on this case, X should be used for Y"
```

**Hedge Appropriately**:
- "This case illustrates..."
- "This observation suggests..."
- "This finding is consistent with..."
- "Further studies are needed to confirm..."

---

## LIMITATIONS SPECIFIC TO CASE REPORTS

**MUST Acknowledge**:
1. **No control group** — cannot establish causation
2. **Single case/small series** — cannot generalize
3. **Selection bias** — case reported BECAUSE of unusual outcome
4. **Publication bias** — positive outcomes more likely reported
5. **Recall bias** — retrospective data collection
6. **Observer bias** — treating physician is often the reporter

**Template**:
```
"This case report has inherent limitations. As a single case, findings
cannot be generalized to broader populations. The temporal association
between treatment and improvement does not establish causation. A
prospective controlled study is needed to evaluate the efficacy of
[treatment] for [condition]."
```

## COMMON ERRORS IN CASE REPORTS

### Error 1: No Clear Justification for Reporting
```
❌ Just describing a routine case
✓ Explicitly state what is novel, rare, or educational
```

### Error 2: Missing Patient Consent
```
❌ No mention of consent
✓ Explicit consent statement or explanation of why waived
```

### Error 3: Identifiable Information
```
❌ Specific dates, institution name, photos without consent
✓ De-identified, relative dates ("Day 1, Day 7"), consent for images
```

### Error 4: Overclaiming from Single Case
```
❌ "This treatment should be adopted for all patients with..."
✓ "This case suggests potential benefit; further study is warranted"
```

### Error 5: Insufficient Clinical Detail
```
❌ Vague descriptions ("labs were abnormal")
✓ Specific values ("Hemoglobin 7.2 g/dL, WBC 15,000/μL")
```

### Error 6: Missing Timeline
```
❌ No dates or temporal sequence
✓ Clear chronological narrative with key dates/timepoints
```

### Error 7: No Discussion of Differential Diagnosis
```
❌ Jumping straight to final diagnosis
✓ Presenting differential and reasoning for final diagnosis
```

## ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS

### Patient Privacy (HIPAA/GDPR)
- Remove ALL 18 HIPAA identifiers (name, dates, location, etc.)
- Use relative dates ("Day 1") not absolute ("January 15, 2025")
- Alter non-essential demographic details if needed for de-identification
- Obtain explicit written consent BEFORE submission

### Images and Media
- Patient photos require explicit written consent
- Black bars over eyes alone are INSUFFICIENT for de-identification
- Consider whether image is truly necessary for the report

### Conflict of Interest
- Disclose if treating physician has financial interest in treatment
- Disclose if treatment is off-label (must state explicitly)

---

## FIELD-SPECIFIC VARIATIONS

### Medical/Clinical Case Reports
- Most common type
- Follow CARE checklist strictly
- Require IRB review or IRB exemption letter (varies by institution)
- Many journals: CARE checklist submission required

### Surgical Case Reports (SCARE Guidelines)
- Extension of CARE for surgical cases
- Additional items: operative findings, perioperative details
- Full guideline: https://www.scareguideline.com/

### Psychological/Psychiatric Case Reports
- Additional emphasis on psychosocial history
- Treatment response timeline especially important
- Consider patient perspective section carefully

### Veterinary Case Reports
- Follow CARE-VET adaptation
- Species-specific normal ranges
- Owner consent (not patient consent)

## ADVERSE EVENT CAUSALITY ASSESSMENT (EXPANDED)

### Required for ANY Adverse Event Reported in a Case Report

```
1. TEMPORAL RELATIONSHIP:
   - Date exposure/treatment began
   - Date symptom onset (interval from start)
   - Date symptom resolved (interval from drug discontinuation if applicable)

2. DOSE-RESPONSE:
   - Did increasing dose worsen symptoms?
   - Did decreasing dose improve symptoms?

3. DECHALLENGE (drug stopped):
   - Was drug/treatment discontinued?
   - If yes, did symptoms improve? Over what timeframe?
   - If not discontinued, explain why (e.g., life-threatening condition)

4. RECHALLENGE (drug restarted):
   - If restarted, did symptoms recur?
   - Note: Often unethical to rechallenge; state explicitly if not done

5. ALTERNATIVE CAUSES:
   - List other drugs, conditions, or exposures that could cause same symptoms
   - Provide evidence against each alternative

6. NARANJO CAUSALITY SCALE:
   Rate as:
   - Definite (≥9): Temporal + dechallenge + rechallenge + no alternatives
   - Probable (5-8): Temporal + dechallenge + no reasonable alternatives
   - Possible (1-4): Temporal relationship only
   - Doubtful (≤0): Alternative explanation more plausible

   FLAG if: Adverse event reported without temporal detail, dechallenge data,
   or alternative cause discussion. Reviewer will question causality claim.
