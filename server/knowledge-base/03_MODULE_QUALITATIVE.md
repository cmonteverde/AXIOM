## PHASE 1: INTRODUCTION ANALYSIS

### Research Question Requirements

**Must Be Open-Ended and Exploratory**:

```
✓ GOOD: "How do first-generation college students experience academic 
  transitions?"
✓ GOOD: "What are the lived experiences of nurses providing end-of-life care?"
✓ GOOD: "How do teachers construct professional identity in urban schools?"

✗ POOR: "Does X cause Y?" (Quantitative framing)
✗ POOR: "How many people experience X?" (Counting, not understanding)
✗ POOR: "Is there a relationship between X and Y?" (Correlational, not meaning-focused)
```

**Components of Strong Qualitative RQ**:
1. **Phenomenon**: What experience/process/culture is being studied?
2. **Population**: Who has experienced this phenomenon?
3. **Context**: Where/when does this occur?
4. **Focus**: Understanding, exploring, describing (not testing or measuring)

### Purpose Statements

**Must Indicate Qualitative Approach**:

```
✓ "The purpose of this phenomenological study is to explore the lived 
  experiences of..."

✓ "This grounded theory study seeks to develop a theoretical model of..."

✓ "Through ethnographic methods, this study examines..."

✗ "This study hypothesizes that..." (Quantitative framing)
```

### Gap Statement for Qualitative Studies

**Justify Why Qualitative Approach Is Needed**:

```
✓ "While quantitative studies have measured X, the subjective experiences 
  and meanings remain unexplored. Qualitative inquiry is needed to understand 
  how individuals make sense of X."

✓ "No existing theory adequately explains Y. Grounded theory methodology 
  will generate theory directly from participant experiences."

✓ "Quantitative measures cannot capture the nuanced cultural practices of Z. 
  Ethnographic observation is required to understand context-dependent meanings."
```

## PHASE 2: METHODS SECTION - COREQ COMPLIANCE

**CRITICAL**: Interview and focus group studies must comply with **COREQ** (32 items)

**Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research**

Full Checklist: https://content.sph.harvard.edu/wwwhsph/sites/2448/2024/02/Consolidated-criteria-for-reporting-qualitative-research-COREQ.pdf

### COREQ Domain 1: Research Team and Reflexivity

#### Item 1-2: Interviewer Characteristics

```
REQUIRED:
- Name or initials of interviewer(s)
- Credentials (PhD, RN, MA, etc.)
- Occupation at time of study
- Gender
- Training and experience in qualitative methods

Example:
"Interviews were conducted by the first author (J.S., PhD, female, 
assistant professor of sociology) who has 8 years experience conducting 
qualitative interviews and completed intensive training in phenomenological 
interviewing methods."
```

#### Item 3-5: Relationship with Participants

```
REQUIRED:
- Was relationship established before study commenced?
- What did participants know about researcher?
- What were interviewer characteristics as reported to participants?

Example:
"Participants were recruited via email and had no prior relationship with 
the interviewer. Participants were informed that the interviewer was a 
university researcher studying nurse experiences, and that she had no 
clinical background (to reduce social desirability bias around clinical 
practices)."
```

#### Item 6-8: Researcher Reflexivity (CRITICAL)

```
REQUIRED:
- Theoretical framework/philosophical orientation
- Personal characteristics/experience that may influence research
- Relationship/potential bias toward research topic

Example:
"This study was guided by interpretive phenomenology (Heidegger). The 
lead researcher identifies as a first-generation college student, which 
provided insider perspective but may have led to over-identification with 
participants. Reflexive journaling throughout data collection helped 
identify and bracket these assumptions."
```

**Reflexivity Statement Template**:
```
"I am a [identity relevant to research]. My [background/experience] 
positioned me as an insider/outsider to participants. I acknowledge 
potential bias toward [topic] based on [personal experience]. To address 
this, I [reflexive practice: journaling, peer debriefing, bracketing]."
```

### COREQ Domain 2: Study Design

#### Item 9: Methodological Orientation

```
REQUIRED: State specific qualitative approach

✓ "This phenomenological study..."
✓ "Using grounded theory methodology..."
✓ "Through ethnographic methods..."

Not sufficient: "This qualitative study..." (too vague)
```

#### Item 10-13: Participant Selection

```
REQUIRED:
- Sampling strategy with rationale
- Method of approach (email, in-person, snowball, etc.)
- Sample size with justification
- Number who declined/reasons for non-participation

Example:
"Purposive sampling identified nurses with ≥5 years hospice experience. 
We approached 32 nurses via email; 18 agreed to participate, 14 declined 
(reasons: time constraints n=10, discomfort with topic n=4). Sample size 
(n=18) was determined by data saturation, reached after 15 interviews 
with 3 additional interviews confirming no new themes emerged."
```

#### Item 14-16: Setting

```
REQUIRED:
- Where data were collected (location, environment)
- Presence of non-participants
- Description of sample

Example:
"Interviews occurred in private conference rooms at participants' hospitals 
(n=12) or via secure Zoom (n=6, participant preference). No non-participants 
were present. Participants were 18 hospice nurses (16 female, 2 male; ages 
28-61; experience 5-23 years; representing 8 different hospitals across 
urban and rural settings)."
```

#### Item 17-21: Data Collection (DETAILED)

```
REQUIRED:
- Interview guide (pilot tested?)
- Repeat interviews conducted? How many?
- Audio/visual recording methods
- Field notes made? By whom?
- Duration of interviews
- Data saturation achieved?
- Transcripts returned to participants for comment?

Example:
"Semi-structured interviews followed a pilot-tested guide (see Appendix A) 
covering: experiences with patient death, coping strategies, workplace 
support, and meaning-making. Interviews were audio-recorded with 
participant consent and averaged 68 minutes (range: 42-105 minutes). 
The interviewer made field notes immediately after each interview 
documenting non-verbal cues and initial impressions. Data saturation was 
achieved after 15 interviews, with 3 additional interviews confirming 
no new themes. Transcripts were not returned to participants due to 
time constraints, but findings were shared for member checking."
```

**Saturation Documentation** (CRITICAL):
```
MUST explicitly state:
- When saturation was reached
- How saturation was determined
- Whether additional interviews confirmed saturation

Example:
"Saturation was determined by two independent coders reviewing transcripts 
after every 3 interviews. After interview 15, no new codes emerged in 3 
consecutive interviews. Three additional interviews (16-18) confirmed 
saturation."
```

### COREQ Domain 3: Analysis and Findings

#### Item 22-26: Data Analysis

```
REQUIRED:
- Number of coders
- Description of coding tree/framework
- How themes were derived
- Software used (if any)
- Whether participants provided feedback on findings

Example:
"Transcripts were analyzed using Braun & Clarke's (2006) thematic analysis. 
Two researchers independently coded all transcripts using NVivo 14. Initial 
open coding identified 127 codes, which were grouped into 18 subthemes 
through axial coding, then consolidated into 5 major themes through 
selective coding. Researchers met weekly to discuss coding decisions and 
resolve discrepancies through consensus. A coding framework was developed 
iteratively and applied to all transcripts. Member checking with 6 
participants confirmed theme resonance and accuracy."
```

**Coding Process Detail Required**:
```
Must describe:
1. Open/initial coding (line-by-line or segment-by-segment)
2. Axial/focused coding (grouping related codes)
3. Selective/thematic coding (identifying major themes)
4. How disagreements between coders were resolved
5. Whether coding framework was predetermined or emerged
```

#### Item 27-29: Reporting

```
REQUIRED:
- Quotations presented (participant identification with quotes)
- Data consistency (themes supported by quotes)
- Clarity of major/minor themes

Example in Results:
"Participants described moral distress as central to their experience:

'Sometimes you know the treatment is futile, but the family wants everything 
done. You're prolonging suffering.' (Participant 7, female, 12 years experience)

'I feel like I'm torturing patients sometimes.' (Participant 3, female, 
8 years experience)

This theme was present in 16 of 18 interviews."
```

**Quote Presentation Best Practices**:
- Use pseudonyms or participant numbers (P1, P2)
- Include relevant demographics with quote (if anonymity allows)
- State how many participants mentioned each theme
- Use "sic" for grammatical errors in quotes (maintain authenticity)
- Use [...] for omitted sections, but don't distort meaning

---

## PHASE 3: QUALITY CRITERIA (NOT Validity/Reliability)

**CRITICAL**: Qualitative research does NOT use quantitative quality terms

### Quantitative vs Qualitative Quality Criteria:

```
Quantitative (DON'T USE):          Qualitative (USE INSTEAD):
- Validity                      →  Credibility
- Reliability                   →  Dependability
- Objectivity                   →  Confirmability
- Generalizability              →  Transferability
```

### 1. Credibility (Parallel to Internal Validity)

**Definition**: Findings accurately represent participants' realities

**Strategies to Establish**:

**Prolonged Engagement**:
```
"The researcher spent 6 months in the community before formal interviews, 
building rapport and understanding context."
```

**Persistent Observation**:
```
"Repeated interviews with each participant (2-3 sessions over 4 months) 
allowed deeper exploration of evolving experiences."
```

**Triangulation**:
```
Data source triangulation: "Interviews, observations, and documents were 
analyzed to corroborate findings."

Investigator triangulation: "Three researchers independently coded data, 
enhancing credibility through multiple perspectives."

Method triangulation: "Interviews and focus groups yielded convergent themes."
```

**Member Checking** (Participant Validation):
```
"A summary of findings was presented to 8 participants for feedback. All 
confirmed themes resonated with their experiences. Two suggested refinements 
to theme labels, which were incorporated."
```

**Negative Case Analysis**:
```
"We actively searched for disconfirming evidence. Three participants described 
positive experiences contrary to the dominant theme. These cases were analyzed 
separately to refine the theme boundaries."
```

### 2. Transferability (Parallel to External Validity)

**Definition**: Findings applicable to other contexts

**Strategies to Establish**:

**Thick Description** (Geertz, 1973):
```
Provide rich, detailed description of:
- Context (setting, culture, environment)
- Participants (demographics, backgrounds)
- Processes (data collection, interactions)

Example:
"The hospice unit was located in a 150-bed urban hospital serving primarily 
low-income patients. The 12-bed unit was staffed by 24 nurses across three 
shifts. The physical environment was dimly lit with individual patient rooms, 
a family lounge, and a staff reflection room rarely used due to understaffing..."

This allows readers to determine whether findings transfer to their context.
```

**Maximum Variation Sampling**:
```
"Purposive sampling sought diversity in: years of experience (5-23 years), 
hospital type (urban/rural, large/small), and demographic backgrounds, 
enhancing transferability across contexts."
```

### 3. Dependability (Parallel to Reliability)

**Definition**: Process is consistent and documented

**Strategies to Establish**:

**Audit Trail**:
```
Maintain documentation of:
- Raw data (recordings, transcripts)
- Analysis notes and memos
- Coding decisions and rationale
- Methodological decisions
- Reflexive journal

Example:
"An audit trail included: all interview recordings, verbatim transcripts, 
coding memos, reflexive journal entries, and records of analytic decisions 
at team meetings. An external auditor (senior qualitative researcher) 
reviewed the trail and confirmed logical consistency from data to findings."
```

**Code-Recode Procedure**:
```
"The lead researcher coded the same transcript twice, two weeks apart, 
achieving 89% consistency, indicating dependable coding."
```

### 4. Confirmability (Parallel to Objectivity)

**Definition**: Findings shaped by participants, not researcher bias

**Strategies to Establish**:

**Reflexive Journaling**:
```
"Throughout data collection and analysis, the researcher maintained a 
reflexive journal documenting personal reactions, assumptions, and 
potential biases. For example, after interviewing Participant 5, the 
researcher noted over-identification with the participant's struggle, 
which prompted more critical analysis of that transcript."
```

**Confirmability Audit**:
```
"An external auditor examined the audit trail to confirm that conclusions 
were grounded in data, not researcher preconceptions. The auditor confirmed 
clear linkages from raw data through codes to themes."
```

**Bracketing** (Phenomenology):
```
"Before data collection, the researcher documented personal experiences 
and assumptions about nurse burnout through written reflection, attempting 
to 'bracket' or set aside these preconceptions during interviewing and 
analysis."
```

---

## PHASE 4: ANALYTICAL APPROACHES

### Thematic Analysis (Most Common)

**Braun & Clarke's 6-Phase Approach**:

```
Phase 1: Familiarization
- Read/re-read transcripts
- Note initial ideas
"All transcripts were read twice by each coder to achieve immersion in data."

Phase 2: Generate Initial Codes
- Systematic coding of interesting features
- Code entire dataset
"Line-by-line coding identified 127 initial codes (e.g., 'emotional exhaustion,' 
'patient bonding,' 'systemic barriers')."

Phase 3: Search for Themes
- Collate codes into potential themes
- Gather all relevant coded extracts
"Codes were grouped into 18 potential themes using affinity diagramming."

Phase 4: Review Themes
- Check themes work in relation to coded extracts and entire dataset
- Generate thematic map
"Two researchers independently reviewed themes. Four were merged due to 
overlap, three were split for clarity, resulting in 15 refined themes."

Phase 5: Define and Name Themes
- Ongoing analysis to refine each theme
- Clear definitions and names
"Themes were defined: 'Moral Distress in Futile Care' described nurses' 
ethical conflict when providing treatments perceived as prolonging suffering..."

Phase 6: Produce Report
- Vivid examples for each theme
- Relate back to research question and literature
"Final analysis identified 5 major themes, each illustrated with participant 
quotes and situated within existing literature on nurse moral distress."
```

### Grounded Theory

**Glaser & Strauss Approach**:

```
1. Open Coding
- Line-by-line coding
- Stay close to data
"What is happening here? What is this about?"

2. Axial Coding
- Relate codes to each other
- Identify categories
"How do these codes connect? What's the relationship?"

3. Selective Coding
- Integrate categories around core category
- Develop theory
"What is the central phenomenon? How do categories relate to it?"

4. Theoretical Sampling
- Sample to develop and refine theory
- Continue until saturation
"After identifying 'managing patient expectations' as a core category, we 
purposively sampled nurses who specialized in difficult family communications 
to elaborate this category."

5. Constant Comparative Method
- Compare incident to incident
- Compare incident to category
- Compare category to category
"Each new interview was compared to previous ones, refining emerging categories."
```

**Theory Development**:
```
Must produce a conceptual model or framework

Example:
"The emergent theory posits that nurses navigate moral distress through a 
three-stage process: (1) Recognizing ethical conflict, (2) Emotional 
suppression or expression, (3) Seeking meaning or leaving the profession. 
This process is mediated by workplace support and personal resilience."
```

### Phenomenology (IPA)

**Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis**:

```
1. Read and re-read
2. Initial noting (descriptive, linguistic, conceptual comments)
3. Develop emergent themes
4. Search for connections across themes
5. Move to next case
6. Look for patterns across cases

Focus: Individual lived experience, idiographic (particular to person)

Example:
"Analysis revealed the essence of nurses' end-of-life care experience as 
'holding paradoxical space': simultaneously providing comfort while 
witnessing inevitable decline, maintaining hope while accepting death, 
and offering presence while managing emotional boundaries."
```

### Ethnography

**Spradley's Developmental Research Sequence**:

```
1. Locating an informant
2. Interviewing an informant  
3. Making an ethnographic record
4. Asking descriptive questions
5. Analyzing ethnographic interviews
6. Making a domain analysis
7. Asking structural questions
8. Making a taxonomic analysis
9. Asking contrast questions
10. Making a componential analysis
11. Discovering cultural themes
12. Taking a cultural inventory
13. Writing the ethnography
```

**Thick Description Required** (Geertz):
```
Not just WHAT happened, but layers of meaning

Thin: "The nurse gave the patient medication."

Thick: "The nurse entered room 304 quietly, glancing first at the family 
gathered around the bed before approaching the patient. She spoke softly, 
explaining each step as she prepared the morphine, her hand briefly touching 
the patient's shoulder - a gesture I observed repeatedly as a culturally 
normative expression of compassion in this hospice setting. The family 
watched intently, and the nurse's deliberate, unhurried movements seemed 
designed to communicate control and care simultaneously..."
```

---

## PHASE 5: RESULTS SECTION STRUCTURE

### Organizing Qualitative Findings

**Standard Structure**:

```
1. Participant Overview
- Demographics table
- Recruitment and response rates
- Brief characterization

2. Major Themes (typically 3-7)
For each theme:
- Theme name and definition
- Subthemes (if applicable)
- Supporting quotes from multiple participants
- Frequency (how many mentioned it)
- Thick description/interpretation

3. Theme Relationships
- How themes connect
- Conceptual model (if grounded theory)
- Overarching narrative
```

### Quote Selection and Presentation

**Rules**:

```
1. Use quotes to ILLUSTRATE themes, not to BE themes
❌ "One theme was: 'I feel overwhelmed.'"
✓ "Participants described feeling overwhelmed by the emotional demands: 
   'I feel overwhelmed.' (P3)"

2. Include participant identifier
"'Sometimes I just cry in the car after shift.' (Participant 7, female, 
15 years experience)"

3. Provide context for quote
"When asked about coping mechanisms, one nurse described: '...'"

4. Use multiple quotes per theme
Show pattern across participants, not just one voice

5. State frequency/prevalence
"This theme was present in 14 of 18 interviews."
"While most participants (n=16) described..., two participants diverged..."

6. Balance quote length
Short quotes (1-2 sentences) for clear points
Longer quotes (paragraph) for complex narratives

7. Edit minimally
Use [...] for omissions
Use [word] for clarification
Use (sic) for errors, but preserve authenticity
```

**Example Theme Presentation**:

```
**Theme 1: Moral Distress in Futile Care**

Participants frequently described ethical conflict when providing care they 
perceived as prolonging suffering rather than promoting comfort (16 of 18 
participants). This moral distress stemmed from tension between professional 
duty, patient/family wishes, and personal ethics.

"Sometimes the family wants everything done, but you know it's futile. You're 
just prolonging the inevitable, and the patient is suffering. But your hands 
are tied." (Participant 12, female, 18 years experience)

Several nurses described this as "torture":

"I feel like I'm torturing people sometimes. They're dying anyway, and we're 
sticking them with needles, putting in tubes. It goes against everything I 
became a nurse for." (Participant 3, female, 8 years experience)

This distress led to emotional exhaustion and questioning professional identity:

"You start to wonder if you're in the right profession. If this is what nursing 
has become - just following orders even when they're wrong." (Participant 9, 
female, 11 years experience)

Only two participants did not express moral distress, both attributing this to 
strong workplace ethics committees that supported their concerns.
```

### Subtheme Structure (If Used)

```
**Major Theme**: Moral Distress
  **Subtheme 1.1**: Futile treatment continuation
  **Subtheme 1.2**: Family-provider conflict
  **Subtheme 1.3**: Systemic pressure to prolong life
```

---

## PHASE 6: DISCUSSION SECTION

### Interpretation vs Description

**Results = Description** (what participants said)
**Discussion = Interpretation** (what it means)

```
Results: "Participants described feeling overwhelmed by emotional demands."

Discussion: "Participants' descriptions of emotional overwhelm align with 
Hochschild's (1983) concept of 'emotional labor' - the requirement to 
manage feelings as part of work. However, our findings extend this theory 
by revealing that in end-of-life care, emotional labor includes not only 
managing one's own emotions but also absorbing and processing family grief..."
```

### Theoretical Contribution (Required)

**Must State**:

```
1. How findings relate to existing theory
"Our findings support Self-Determination Theory but reveal a previously 
unrecognized dimension..."

2. What's new or different
"Contrary to previous research suggesting X, our participants described Y..."

3. Theoretical implications
"These findings suggest existing models of nurse burnout should incorporate 
moral distress as a distinct construct, not merely emotional exhaustion..."
```

### Transferability Statement (Required)

**Unlike "generalizability," transferability is reader-determined**

```
Template:
"While these findings are specific to [context], they may transfer to similar 
contexts where [conditions]. Readers can assess transferability based on the 
thick description provided regarding [setting, participants, processes]."

Example:
"While these findings are context-specific to hospice nurses in urban 
hospitals, they may transfer to other end-of-life care settings (palliative 
care, ICU) where similar ethical tensions arise. The thick description of 
institutional constraints, patient populations, and nurse demographics allows 
readers to judge applicability to their contexts."
```

### Reflexive Statement (Recommended)

```
"As a former hospice nurse, the lead researcher's insider status facilitated 
rapport but may have led to assumptions about shared understanding. Reflexive 
journaling and member checking helped mitigate this potential bias. An outsider 
perspective (second coder with no clinical background) provided critical 
distance during analysis."
```

---

## PHASE 7: LIMITATIONS SPECIFIC TO QUALITATIVE RESEARCH

### Common Qualitative Limitations to Acknowledge:

**Sample Limitations**:
```
"Participants were recruited from a single geographic region, limiting 
diversity of experiences."

"Purposive sampling may have excluded voices of nurses who left the profession 
due to moral distress, representing survivor bias."
```

**Social Desirability Bias**:
```
"Despite assurances of confidentiality, participants may have modified 
responses due to social desirability, particularly regarding workplace 
conflicts."
```

**Researcher Influence**:
```
"The researcher's presence and questioning shaped participant responses. 
While reflexive practices addressed this, complete neutrality is impossible 
in qualitative research."
```

**Temporal Limitations**:
```
"Interviews captured experiences at a single timepoint. Longitudinal 
interviews would reveal how experiences evolve over careers."
```

**Member Checking Limitations** (if partial):
```
"Only 6 of 18 participants provided feedback on findings due to difficulty 
re-contacting participants. Full member checking may have further refined 
themes."
```

---

## COMMON ERRORS IN QUALITATIVE RESEARCH

### Error 1: Quantifying Qualitative Data Inappropriately

```
❌ "63% of participants felt overwhelmed" (from n=8 interviews - meaningless %)
❌ Statistical tests on theme frequency

✓ "Most participants (6 of 8) described feeling overwhelmed"
✓ "This theme was present across all interviews"
```

### Error 2: Using "Validity" and "Reliability"

```
❌ "To ensure validity and reliability..."
✓ "To ensure credibility and dependability..."

Use qualitative quality criteria
```

### Error 3: Insufficient Quotes

```
❌ One quote per theme across 5 themes (inadequate evidence)
✓ Multiple quotes per theme, showing pattern across participants
```

### Error 4: No Reflexivity Statement

```
COREQ requires researcher reflexivity
Must address positionality and potential biases
```

### Error 5: Saturation Not Discussed

```
❌ "We interviewed 12 participants" (why 12? Random stopping?)
✓ "Data saturation occurred after 9 interviews; 3 additional interviews 
   confirmed no new themes emerged"
```

### Error 6: Themes = Code Labels

```
❌ Theme: "Overwhelmed" (just a code)
✓ Theme: "Navigating Overwhelming Emotional Demands Through Compartmentalization" 
   (interpretive, conceptual)
```

### Error 7: No Thick Description

```
❌ "Participant 3 was a nurse" (thin)
✓ "Participant 3 was a 42-year-old female hospice nurse with 15 years 
   experience, working night shift in a 150-bed urban hospital serving 
   primarily uninsured patients..." (thick - enables transferability)
```

## FIELD-SPECIFIC VARIATIONS

### Nursing/Healthcare Qualitative Research

**Common Approaches**: Phenomenology, grounded theory
**Journals Often Require**: COREQ compliance, clinical implications
**Typical Sample Sizes**: 10-30 participants

### Education Qualitative Research

**Common Approaches**: Case study, ethnography, narrative
**Focus**: Classroom/school culture, student/teacher experiences
**Typical Sample Sizes**: Varies widely (1 case study to 50+ interviews)

### Anthropology

**Approach**: Ethnography dominant
**Requirements**: Extended fieldwork (months to years), thick description
**Focus**: Cultural practices, meanings, rituals

### Psychology

**Common Approach**: IPA (Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis)
**Sample Sizes**: Typically small (3-6 for IPA)
**Focus**: Individual lived experience, idiographic

### Sociology

**Common Approaches**: Grounded theory, ethnography, content analysis
**Focus**: Social processes, structures, inequalities
**May Combine**: Qualitative + quantitative (mixed methods)

---

## SPECIAL TOPICS

### Focus Groups (vs Individual Interviews)

**When to Use**: Group interaction produces data (not just efficiency)

**Additional COREQ Requirements**:
```
- Group size and composition
- Facilitation strategy (moderator role)
- How group dynamics influenced data
- Whether participants knew each other
```

**Analysis Difference**:
```
Must analyze group interaction, not just individual statements

Example:
"When Participant 3 described moral distress, Participants 5 and 7 
immediately nodded and built on this theme, suggesting shared experience. 
However, Participant 2 disagreed, prompting group discussion that refined 
understanding of context-dependent nature of moral distress."
```

### Photo Elicitation / Visual Methods

**Requires**:
```
- Informed consent for photo use
- Whose photos? (participant-generated vs researcher-provided)
- How photos were used in interviews
- Ethical considerations (faces, identifiable locations)
```

### Secondary Analysis of Qualitative Data

**Requires**:
```
- Description of original study
- How data were accessed
- Ethical approval for secondary use
- Fit between original and current research questions
```

## SATURATION DEFINITION VALIDATION (EXPANDED)

### COREQ Item 21b: Saturation Must Be Explicitly Defined

Qualitative research MUST specify which type of saturation was achieved:

```
SATURATION TYPES:
1. Code Saturation: No new codes emerge in final N interviews
   - Must state N (e.g., "no new codes in 3 consecutive interviews")
   - Independent verification preferred

2. Meaning Saturation: Existing codes develop no new nuances
   - Deeper than code saturation — codes exist but new dimensions stop appearing
   - Requires explicit coding memo trail

3. Theoretical Saturation: Categories are fully developed per methodology
   - Grounded theory specific
   - Must demonstrate category relationships are explained

4. Pragmatic Saturation: Resource-limited (acknowledge explicitly)
   - Acceptable if acknowledged: "Saturation was not formally assessed due to [reason]"
   - Must discuss implications for transferability
```

### Sample Size Thresholds by Methodology

```
FLAG if sample size is unusually low WITHOUT saturation justification:
- Phenomenology (IPA): Minimum 3-6 participants (small by design)
- Grounded Theory: Minimum 20-30 participants for theoretical saturation
- Thematic Analysis: Minimum 6-12 participants for code saturation
- Focus Groups: Minimum 3-4 groups (4-8 per group)
- Ethnography: Extended engagement (months, not days)
- Case Study: 1-5 cases (justified by depth, not breadth)
```

### Saturation Reporting Template
```
GOOD: "Code saturation was operationalized as no new codes emerging in 3
consecutive interviews, assessed independently by two coders (achieved after
interview 12; interviews 13-15 confirmed saturation)."

FLAG: "Data saturation was reached" (no definition, no operationalization)
FLAG: "n=6, saturation achieved" (unusually low without justification)
```
