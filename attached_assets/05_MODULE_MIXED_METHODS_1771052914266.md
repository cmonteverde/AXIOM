# SAGE MODULE: MIXED METHODS
**Module 05 - Sequential, Concurrent, Embedded Designs**
**Version 3.0**
**Last Updated: February 2026**

---

## MODULE SCOPE

This module applies to studies that intentionally combine:
- **Quantitative data** (numbers, statistics, closed-ended)
- **Qualitative data** (words, themes, open-ended)

**Key Characteristic**: Integration of both approaches to answer research question more completely than either alone.

---

## DOCUMENT CLASSIFICATION

### Auto-Detection Keywords:
```
Primary Triggers:
- "mixed methods", "mixed-methods"
- "sequential explanatory", "sequential exploratory"
- "concurrent design", "convergent design"
- "embedded design"
- "integration", "mixing", "merged", "connected"
- "QUAN + QUAL", "qualitative and quantitative"
- "triangulation"

Must contain BOTH quantitative AND qualitative keywords
```

### Design Types:

**1. Sequential Explanatory** (QUAN → qual)
- Quantitative phase first
- Qualitative phase explains/elaborates findings
- Most common in health research

**2. Sequential Exploratory** (QUAL → quan)
- Qualitative phase first  
- Quantitative phase tests/generalizes findings
- Common in instrument development

**3. Convergent (Concurrent)** (QUAN + QUAL)
- Both collected simultaneously
- Compared/merged in analysis
- Equal priority typically

**4. Embedded**
- One strand embedded within other
- Often qual within RCT

---

## PHASE 1: METHODS SECTION REQUIREMENTS

### Must Load Multiple Modules:

**Core + Mixed Methods + Relevant Quant/Qual Modules**

Example:
- If Sequential (QUAN→qual): Load 01_QUANTITATIVE + 03_QUALITATIVE + 05_MIXED
- If embedded qual in RCT: Load 01_QUANTITATIVE + 03_QUALITATIVE + 05_MIXED

### Integration Statement (CRITICAL)

**Must explicitly state**:
```
"This sequential explanatory mixed methods study collected quantitative data 
(n=200 survey) to identify patterns of social media use and depression, 
followed by qualitative interviews (n=18) to explain HOW and WHY these 
patterns occur. Integration occurred at interpretation stage by using 
quantitative findings to guide interview questions and comparing qual themes 
to quant results."
```

### GRAMMS Reporting Guidelines

**Good Reporting of A Mixed Methods Study (19 items)**

Key items:
1. Justification for mixed methods
2. Design type and notation
3. Priority/weighting
4. Sequence and timing
5. Integration points
6. Limitations of integration

---

## PHASE 2: INTEGRATION (THE CRITICAL ELEMENT)

### Integration ≠ Just Having Both

**Not Mixed Methods**:
```
❌ Survey (quant) + interviews (qual) analyzed separately, reported in 
   separate sections, no connection made
   
This is "multi-method" not "mixed methods"
```

**True Mixed Methods**:
```
✓ Survey findings identify that high social media users report more depression
✓ Interview sampling specifically targets high users to explore mechanisms  
✓ Interview themes explain WHY (comparison processes, FOMO, sleep disruption)
✓ Discussion integrates: "Quantitative data showed association (r=.34), 
  qualitative data revealed three causal mechanisms..."
```

### Integration Points:

**1. Design Level** - Methods inform each other
**2. Methods Level** - Data collection tools connect  
**3. Analysis Level** - Datasets merged or compared
**4. Interpretation Level** - Findings synthesized

### Integration Strategies:

**Merging**:
```
Qual → codes/themes → quantified → analyzed with quant data
Or: Quant + Qual analyzed side-by-side in joint display

Example Joint Display Table:
| Quant Finding | Qual Theme | Convergence |
|---------------|------------|-------------|
| r = .34 social media-depression | "Comparison leads to inadequacy" | Confirms + elaborates mechanism |
```

**Connecting**:
```
Phase 1 findings → inform → Phase 2 sampling/questions

Example:
"Survey identified 3 clusters of users. Purposive sampling selected 6 
participants from each cluster for interviews to explore within-cluster 
experiences."
```

**Embedding**:
```
Qual strand addresses different question within larger quant study

Example:
"RCT tested intervention effectiveness (quant). Embedded interviews explored 
participant experiences with intervention to understand mechanisms of action 
(qual)."
```

## PHASE 3: RESULTS PRESENTATION

### Separate Then Integrate:

**Structure**:
```
1. Quantitative Results
   [Report per Module 01 or 02 standards]

2. Qualitative Results  
   [Report per Module 03 standards]

3. Integration / Joint Display
   [Show how findings connect/diverge]
```

### Joint Display Examples:

**Convergence Table**:
```
| Construct | Quant Evidence | Qual Evidence | Conclusion |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|------------|
| Emotional labor | β = .45** | Theme: "Hiding feelings" | Convergent - both confirm |
| Systemic support | β = .12 ns | Theme: "Workplace barriers" | Divergent - qual reveals nuance |
```

**Integration Narrative**:
```
"Quantitative analysis found social support predicted lower depression 
(β = -.32). Qualitative interviews revealed two types of support: emotional 
validation (helpful) vs unsolicited advice (unhelpful). This explains 
moderate effect size - social support is beneficial only when appropriate 
type."
```

## COMMON ERRORS

### Error 1: No Integration

```
❌ "We did a survey and interviews" [separate, no connection]
✓ "Survey identified high-risk group; interviews with this group explored 
   underlying mechanisms"
```

### Error 2: Unclear Integration Point

```
❌ "Data were integrated during analysis" [vague]
✓ "Integration occurred by: (1) using survey results to create purposive 
   sampling strategy for interviews, (2) developing interview guide questions 
   based on unexpected survey findings, (3) comparing themes to correlation 
   patterns via joint display table"
```

### Error 3: Dominance Not Justified

```
❌ n=500 survey, n=3 interviews [qual token, not truly mixed]
✓ Explain why: "Qual strand smaller due to in-depth nature and saturation 
   achieved at n=18"
```
