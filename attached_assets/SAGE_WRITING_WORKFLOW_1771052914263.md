## WHAT THIS IS

This is **SAGE's writing methodology** - evidence-based strategies to help you write research papers more efficiently and with less stress. This is **separate from manuscript review** and helps you during the writing process itself.

**When to use this**: When you're stuck, procrastinating, or want to write more productively.

## THE SAGE WRITING SYSTEM

Based on cognitive science research about how writing actually works in your brain.

### The Core Problem:

Writing feels hard because your brain is doing **6 things simultaneously**:
1. Deciding what to say (content)
2. Figuring out how to say it (language)
3. Remembering who you're saying it to (audience)
4. Tracking what you've already said (coherence)
5. Planning what comes next (structure)
6. Judging whether it's good (evaluation)

**SAGE Solution**: Do these tasks **separately** using proven workflows.

## WORKFLOW 1: THE ASSEMBLY LINE METHOD

**Problem**: Most people write Title → Introduction → Methods → Results → Discussion → Abstract (front to back)

**Why this fails**: Introduction requires the highest cognitive load when you have the least material.

### SAGE Assembly Line (Cognitive Load Order):

```
Write in this order:

1. FIGURES & TABLES (Visual thinking - you have your data, just arrange it)
2. METHODS (Procedural recall - you did this, just document it)
3. RESULTS (Descriptive reporting - narrate your figures, no interpretation yet)
4. DISCUSSION (Interpretive thinking - now you have results to interpret)
5. INTRODUCTION (Rhetorical framing - now you know what you're promising)
6. ABSTRACT & TITLE (Compression - requires knowing the whole)
```

**Why this works**: Each section provides raw material for the next section. You're never facing a blank page.

### Example Workflow:

**Day 1**: Create all figures and tables
- Arrange your data visually
- Label everything clearly
- This is your manuscript's skeleton

**Day 2**: Write Methods
- You did this work - just document it like a recipe
- Low cognitive load - procedural memory

**Day 3**: Write Results  
- Narrate your figures: "Figure 1 shows..."
- The figures tell you what to write
- Pure description, no interpretation

**Day 4**: Write Discussion
- Now you have results to interpret
- Connect to literature
- Higher cognitive load, but you have material

**Day 5**: Write Introduction
- You know exactly what you're promising now
- Frame your contribution accurately
- No guessing about what the paper argues

**Day 6**: Write Abstract & Title
- Compress what you've already written
- Final synthesis step

## WORKFLOW 2: THE SPRINT DRAFT METHOD

**Problem**: Trying to write and edit simultaneously burns mental energy and breaks flow.

**Brain Science**: Your brain has two incompatible modes:
- **Generative** (creating) - expansive, fast, associative
- **Evaluative** (judging) - contractive, slow, critical

Switching between these modes creates "task-switching costs" that drain energy.

### SAGE Sprint Draft (Separate Generate from Evaluate):

**Phase 1 - SPRINT (25-45 minutes)**:
```
Rules:
1. Write as fast as possible
2. Do NOT stop to fix anything
3. Do NOT check references
4. Do NOT re-read
5. Use placeholders: [REF], [STATS], [FIX], [TRANSITION]

Goal: Get words on the page, not perfect words
```

**Phase 2 - REFINE (Later - different session)**:
```
Now you can:
- Fix typos
- Add references
- Polish sentences
- Fill in placeholders

Raw material is infinitely easier to edit than a blank page
```

**The Mantra**: "You can't shape sand while you're shoveling it. First shovel, then shape."

## WORKFLOW 3: STRUCTURAL TEMPLATES

**Problem**: Every structural decision burns mental fuel.

**SAGE Solution**: Use proven templates so you focus on content, not organization.

### Template 1: Results Structure

**For each finding, use this pattern**:
```
REMIND → DESCRIBE → EXPLAIN

1. REMIND: "To test whether X affects Y..."
2. DESCRIBE: "We found a significant effect, t(58) = 3.45, p = .001, d = 0.72"
3. EXPLAIN: "Participants who received X showed higher Y compared to controls"
```

Readers never get lost because you link each result to its research question.

### Template 2: Discussion Structure

**Follow this sequence**:
```
1. SUMMARY (1 paragraph): Restate main findings
2. INTERPRETATION (2-3 paragraphs): What do results mean?
3. COMPARE TO LITERATURE (2-4 paragraphs): How do findings relate to prior work?
4. LIMITATIONS (1-2 paragraphs): What went wrong, what's the scope?
5. FUTURE DIRECTIONS (1 paragraph): What's next?
6. CONCLUSION (1 paragraph): Synthesize impact
```

### Template 3: Limitations Framework

**Three-part structure** for each limitation:
```
Part 1 (20%): Identify the constraint
Part 2 (65%): Explain impact on results
Part 3 (15%): Suggest how future research addresses it

Example:
"Sample size (n=45) was constrained by recruitment challenges common in 
rare disease populations (IDENTIFY). Sensitivity analyses indicated the 
main effect remained robust (d = 0.68, 95% CI [0.31, 1.05]) (IMPACT). 
Future multi-site collaborations could achieve n>200 to detect smaller 
effect sizes (FUTURE)."
```

## WORKFLOW 4: HIERARCHICAL REVISION

**Problem**: People fix whatever catches their eye - a typo here, weak word there. This wastes time polishing sentences that might get deleted.

**SAGE Revision Order** (Big problems to small):

```
1. STRUCTURE (Affects entire paper)
   - Is the argument logical?
   - Are sections in right order?
   - Does it flow broad → narrow → broad?

2. CLARITY (Affects paragraphs)
   - Does each paragraph have one job?
   - Is there redundancy?
   - Can anything be cut?

3. STYLE (Affects sentences)
   - Remove weasel words (seems, perhaps)
   - Strengthen verbs
   - Tighten prose

4. PROOFING (Affects words)
   - Grammar
   - Spelling
   - Formatting
```

**Why this order**: Changes that affect the most text come first. Never polish a sentence that might get deleted.

**The Metaphor**: "Don't polish the silverware while your house is on fire."

## WORKFLOW 5: AI AS WRITING PARTNER

**SAGE Position**: AI is a thinking partner, not a ghostwriter.

### What AI Does Well:

**Structural Diagnosis**:
```
Prompt: "Extract the logical outline of this draft. Where is the reasoning weak?"

AI finds gaps you miss when you're deep in the text
```

**Red Team Review**:
```
Prompt: "Act as a skeptical reviewer. Identify 3 methodological concerns 
with this study."

Better to find holes now than in rejection letter
```

**Clarity Editing**:
```
Prompt: "Improve clarity and conciseness without changing meaning. 
Every word must earn its place."

Offloads micro-level optimization
```

### What AI Shouldn't Do:

❌ Write your paper start to finish (hallucinates, generic, lacks your voice)
❌ Generate your arguments (that's your intellectual contribution)
❌ Replace your thinking (it's a tool, not a replacement)

**SAGE Principle**: AI offloads critique and optimization so your working memory can focus on the intellectual work that actually matters.

## PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER

### Week 1: Assembly Line (Days 1-6)
- Day 1: Figures/tables
- Day 2: Methods
- Day 3: Results
- Day 4: Discussion  
- Day 5: Introduction
- Day 6: Abstract/Title

### Week 2: Refinement (Sprint + Revise)
- Morning: Sprint draft sections that need expansion
- Afternoon: Hierarchical revision (structure → clarity → style → proofing)
- Use AI for structural diagnosis

### Week 3: Final Polish
- Red team review with AI
- Address feedback
- Final proofread

---

## WHEN YOU'RE STUCK

### Can't start Introduction?
→ Write Results first (Assembly Line Method)

### Writing feels overwhelming?
→ Do a 25-minute Sprint Draft with no editing

### Don't know how to organize Discussion?
→ Use the Discussion Template (Summary → Interpret → Compare → Limitations → Future → Conclusion)

### Perfectionism paralysis?
→ Remember: Raw material > Blank page. Sprint first, edit later.

### Not sure if argument is logical?
→ Use AI for structural diagnosis

## REMEMBER

**Writing productivity runs on systems, not willpower.**

You're not bad at writing. You're running your brain's software on the wrong operating system. These workflows give your brain the structure it needs to write efficiently.

Try one workflow with your next paper. Then try another. Build your system.
