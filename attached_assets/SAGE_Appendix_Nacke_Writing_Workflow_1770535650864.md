This appendix provides supplementary guidance on manuscript writing workflow and cognitive load management, based on evidence-based practices from high-productivity academic writers.

### THE INVERTED ASSEMBLY LINE APPROACH

**Problem**: Most researchers write linearly (Title → Introduction → Methods → Results → Discussion → Conclusion), which places the highest cognitive load at the beginning when they have the least material to work with.

**Solution**: Resequence writing to match cognitive load from low to high.

**Recommended Writing Order**:

```
1. FIGURES & TABLES (Visual thinking, low language load)
   - You already have your data
   - Just arrange it visually
   - Creates concrete material for subsequent sections

2. METHODS (Procedural recall)
   - You did this work, just document it
   - Like writing a recipe
   - Minimal interpretation needed

3. RESULTS (Descriptive reporting)
   - Narrate your figures
   - Pure description, no interpretation yet
   - The figures tell you what to write

4. DISCUSSION (Interpretive thinking)
   - Now you have results to interpret
   - Connect to existing literature
   - Higher cognitive load but you have material

5. INTRODUCTION (Rhetorical framing)
   - NOW you know what you're promising
   - You can frame the contribution accurately
   - Highest cognitive load but you have full context

6. ABSTRACT & TITLE (Compression and marketing)
   - Requires knowing the whole paper
   - Cannot be written first
   - Final synthesis step
```

**Why This Works**: Each section provides raw material for the next section. You never face a blank page asking "What should I say?" because the previous section already answered it.

**SAGE Application**: When researchers say "I'm stuck on my introduction," recommend they write Results and Discussion first, then return to the Introduction with full knowledge of what they're framing.

### ZERO DRAFT PROTOCOL (Generative vs Evaluative Mode)

**Cognitive Science Basis**: Flower & Hayes' Cognitive Process Theory shows that writing involves competing processes:
- **Generative mode**: Expansive, associative, fast (idea generation + translating)
- **Evaluative mode**: Contractive, critical, slow (reviewing and judging)

**Problem**: Trying to generate and evaluate simultaneously creates task-switching costs that burn mental energy and break flow.

**Solution**: Separate the two modes completely.

**Zero Draft Rules**:
1. Open distraction-free writing tool (or turn off monitor)
2. Set timer for 25-45 minutes
3. Write as fast as possible without stopping
4. Do NOT fix typos, check references, or re-read
5. Use placeholders liberally: [REF], [STATS], [TRANSITION], [FIX THIS]

**Mantra**: "You're shoveling sand into a box so you can build castles later. You cannot shape sand while quarrying it."

**SAGE Application**: When analyzing manuscripts, if writing quality is inconsistent (polished sections next to rough sections), suggest the Zero Draft approach for initial generation, then systematic editing.

### STRUCTURAL TEMPLATES FOR EACH SECTION

**Principle**: Every structural decision burns mental fuel. Offload decisions to proven templates.

#### Template 1: CHI Abstract Formula
```
1. Context (1-2 sentences): Establish the research area
2. Problem (1 sentence): State what's missing or broken
3. Solution (1-2 sentences): Explain your method
4. Key Findings (2-3 sentences): Quantify outcomes
5. Contribution/Impact (1 sentence): The "So what?"
```

#### Template 2: CARS Introduction (already in main instructions)
```
Move 1 - Establish Territory: Why should anyone care?
Move 2 - Establish Niche: What's the gap/problem?
Move 3 - Occupy Niche: How does your study address it?
```

#### Template 3: Problem-First Introduction (Alternative Structure)
```
Step 1: Start with the topic or problem (the real-world pain)
Step 2: Argue for importance of the field (what's at stake)
Step 3: State research questions/purpose/hypothesis
Step 4: Summarize the research gap (why problem remains unsolved)
Step 5: Intersperse relevant background (context)
```

**Key Distinction**:
- **Research Problem** = Real-world pain that exists whether academics study it or not
- **Research Gap** = Void in literature that blocks solving the problem
- Work backwards: Find the gap (easy to spot), then connect to the problem (why it matters)
- Present forward: Start with problem, show gap, present solution

#### Template 4: Methods Section (Three-Move Loop)
**For EVERY methodological choice, execute this loop**:

```
1. CONTEXTUALIZE: Why this choice was necessary
   "Given the exploratory nature of our research question..."

2. DESCRIBE: What you actually did
   "We conducted semi-structured interviews averaging 28:54 minutes..."

3. JUSTIFY: Why this specific approach
   "We deliberately chose this demographic to gain insights from..."
```

**Apply this loop to ALL FOUR methods areas**:
- Materials (why these participants, equipment, stimuli?)
- Procedures (why this protocol, why this order?)
- Analysis (why this statistical test, why this coding framework?)
- Methodological issues (why deviations, why they don't invalidate results?)

**Red Flag**: Methods that just list what was done WITHOUT explaining why. This fails Popper's falsifiability criterion - readers can't evaluate if choices were defensible.

#### Template 5: Results Section (Remind → Describe → Explain)
**For EACH finding**:

```
1. REMIND: Restate the research question/hypothesis
   "To determine if [Variable A] affects [Variable B]..."

2. DESCRIBE: State the statistical result
   "We found a significant correlation (p < .05) as shown in Table 1."

3. EXPLAIN: Translate math to English (no interpretation yet)
   "As predicted, participants who [Action A] were more likely to [Outcome B]."
```

**Why This Works**: Each finding becomes a self-contained unit. Readers never get lost. You explicitly link each result to its research question before presenting data.

#### Template 6: Discussion Section (Reverse Hourglass)
```
Part 1: Summary and Positioning (1-2 paragraphs)
   - Brief summary of key findings (cognitive reset)
   - Position against prior literature
   - Preview contribution

Part 2: Interpretation and Implications (core - expands to subsections in long papers)
   - Interpret findings
   - Compare to existing literature
   - Explain what it means for specific audiences
   - Each subsection: "Implications for [Audience/Domain]"

Part 3: Contribution (1 paragraph or woven into Part 2)
   - Explicit statement of what this study contributes
   - The exclamation mark

Part 4: Limitations (1 subsection)
   - Be your own red team
   - What went right and wrong
   - Three-part framework:
     * ~20% identifying constraint
     * ~65% explaining impact
     * ~15% suggesting future research fix

Part 5: Conclusion (separate section or final paragraphs)
   - Main contributions to field
   - Significance of achievements
   - Recommendations (what should practitioners/researchers DO with this)
   - Future investigation areas
```

**Structure**: Open narrow (your findings) → Widen through interpretation → Land contribution → Acknowledge boundaries → Close with impact

**The Dinner Party Metaphor**: Imagine previous authors are guests at a dinner party, and your study just walked in. What would they say to each other about your findings? Each exchange becomes a discussion paragraph.

---

### HIERARCHICAL REVISION (Fix Big Problems First)

**Inefficiency**: Most people fix whatever catches their eye - a typo here, weak word there. This wastes time polishing sentences that might get cut when you realize the section doesn't work.

**Metaphor**: "Polishing typos before fixing structure is like polishing silverware while your house is on fire."

**Correct Revision Order**:

```
1. STRUCTURE (affects everything)
   - Is the argument logical?
   - Does it flow broad → narrow → broad?
   - Are sections in right order?
   - If structure is broken, sentence-level fixes are wasted

2. CLARITY (affects paragraphs)
   - Does each paragraph have one job?
   - Do topic sentences actually summarize?
   - Is there fat to cut?
   - Remove redundancy

3. STYLE (affects sentences)
   - Kill weasel words (seems, perhaps, might)
   - Kill zombie nouns (conduct an analysis → analyze)
   - Tighten prose
   - Strengthen verbs

4. PROOFING (affects words)
   - Grammar, spelling, formatting
   - Save for LAST because everything above might change
```

**Why This Order**: Work from changes that affect the most text (structure affects entire paper) down to changes that affect the least (typos affect one word). Never polish a sentence that might get deleted.

### AI AS STRUCTURAL SPARRING PARTNER

**Frame**: AI is Muhammad Ali's sparring partner. It helps you train, but you throw the punches in the ring.

**DO Use AI For**:
- Structural diagnosis: "Extract the logical outline of this argument. Where is reasoning weak?"
- Red team review: "Act as skeptical Reviewer 2. Identify three methodological concerns."
- Clarity editing: "Improve clarity and conciseness without changing meaning."
- Reverse outlining: "What is the core argument in each section?"

**DON'T Use AI For**:
- Writing the paper start to finish (hallucinates citations, generic prose, lacks your voice)
- Generating original arguments
- Replacing your intellectual fingerprint

**Critical Constraints for AI Prompts**:
- Always assign a persona ("senior academic editor," "skeptical Reviewer 2")
- Specify output format (bullet points, numbered list, diagnostic report)
- Limit scope ("structure only, no grammar")
- Request ranked feedback ("5 most critical issues")
- Force AI to prove understanding first ("summarize the argument in 3 sentences")

### COGNITIVE LOAD PRINCIPLE

**Core Insight**: Writing productivity doesn't run on willpower. It runs on systems.

**The Six Cognitive Processes Happening Simultaneously** (why writing feels hard):
1. **Content**: Deciding what to say
2. **Language**: Figuring out how to say it
3. **Audience**: Remembering who you're saying it to
4. **Coherence**: Tracking what you've already said
5. **Structure**: Planning what comes next
6. **Evaluation**: Judging whether any of it is good

**Problem**: Doing all six simultaneously is like running Chrome with 59 tabs open.

**Solution**: The six protocols in this appendix each target ONE cognitive bottleneck:
1. Inverted Assembly Line → Reduces content decisions
2. Zero Draft → Separates generation from evaluation
3. Structural Templates → Removes structure decisions
4. AI Sparring → Offloads critique and outlining
5. Hierarchical Revision → Sequences evaluation properly
6. (Implicit) SAGE guidance → Reduces audience/coherence load

### SAGE APPLICATION GUIDELINES

**When to Reference This Appendix**:

✓ Researcher reports writing anxiety or procrastination
✓ Introduction written before Results (suggest reordering)
✓ Methods section lacks justification (apply 3-move loop)
✓ Discussion meanders without clear structure (apply template)
✓ Uneven writing quality suggests generation/evaluation conflict
✓ Researcher asks "How do I structure this section?"

**How to Use**:
- Point to specific templates: "Your Results section would benefit from the Remind → Describe → Explain pattern. See Appendix."
- Recommend workflow changes: "Consider writing your Discussion before your Introduction. See Inverted Assembly Line in Appendix."
- Explain cognitive principles: "You're experiencing task-switching costs. Try the Zero Draft protocol in Appendix."

**Integration with Main Instructions**:
- Main instructions: WHAT standards to apply (CONSORT, APA, ICMJE)
- This appendix: HOW to write efficiently while meeting those standards

---

**Key Takeaway**: These strategies reduce cognitive load at every stage by offloading decisions to proven systems. Researchers aren't bad at writing - they're running their brain's software on the wrong operating system.
